### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
- To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](issues?q=label%3Abug) or in [existing bug reports](https://community.anytype.io/c/bug-reports/l/latest?board=default) created by users.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?

> You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [security@anytype.io](mailto:security@anytype.io) (please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details).

If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new/choose)
- Click `Get started` next to `Bug report` section
- Explain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.
- Please provide as much context as possible and describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.
- Provide the information you collected in the previous section.

Once it's filed:

- A team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps.
- If the team is able to reproduce the issue and the issue will be left to be addressed by the team or contributors.

### Requesting Features

#### Before Requesting a Feature

- Make sure that you are using the latest version.
- If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question).
- To see if other users already requested something similar you are suggesting, check the [tracker](issues?q=label%3Aenhancement) or [feature requests](https://community.anytype.io/c/feature-requests/l/latest?board=default) created by users.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](/issues).

- Open an [Issue](/issues/new/choose)
- Click `Get started` next to `Feature request` section
- Follow the template and feel free to add more details

### Reporting Security Issues

You must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs including sensitive information to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to [security@anytype.io](mailto:security@anytype.io) (please see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for details).
